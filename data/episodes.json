    "summary": "\"The Seinfeld Chronicles\" (also known as \"Good News, Bad News\", \"Pilot\", \"The Premiere\", or simply \"Seinfeld\") is the pilot episode of the American sitcom Seinfeld, which first aired on NBC on July 5, 1989.\nThe first of the 180 Seinfeld episodes, it was written by show creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and directed by Art Wolff. It introduces three of the show's main cast: the fictionalized version of Seinfeld; his best friend George (Jason Alexander); and neighbor \"Kessler\", soon to be renamed Kramer (Michael Richards). In this episode, a woman calls on Jerry while she is in town, and George tries to read between the lines before she arrives.\nThe story line and main characters were inspired by real-life events and people. Though NBC executives were unsure about the show, they, as Warren Littlefield later stated, \"all said, 'Ah, what the hell, let's try a pilot on this thing and see what happens'.\" However, test audiences reacted extremely negatively. Although NBC would still broadcast the pilot to see how audiences and critics reacted, they decided not to order a first season of the show. Castle Rock Entertainment, which produced the pilot (and the subsequent series), had another pilot produced for NBC featuring actress Ann Jillian in her own eponymous series. After The Seinfeld Chronicles' poor reception, the production company turned to Jillian's series, which tested better and had earned a full-season order (it ran a single 13-episode season and was cancelled by the end of 1990).\nWhen The Seinfeld Chronicles aired, it was watched by nearly 11% of American households and received generally positive reviews from television critics, most of whom were disappointed that NBC did not order a first season. Convinced that the show had potential, and supported by the positive reviews, NBC executive Rick Ludwin convinced his superiors to order a four-episode first season (the smallest order in American television history), offering a part of his personal budget in return. The show, renamed Seinfeld, went on to become among the most successful sitcoms in television history.",

It is considered a \"bottle episode\", and NBC executives objected to its production and broadcast due to its lack of an involved storyline, thinking that audiences would be uninterested. It was not until David threatened to quit if NBC forced any major changes upon the script that NBC allowed the episode to be produced, though NBC postponed broadcast to near the end of season two. Jason Alexander later said, \"They thought this was a betrayal. They thought this was just sacrilege,\" adding, \"To me, it was the defining beginning of the anarchy of Seinfeld.\"\nTelevision critics reacted positively to \"The Chinese Restaurant\", widely considering it one of the show's \"classic episodes\".

The episode aired one week before the two-part clip show and the two-part series finale aired. It was a rare late-series return to a \"plot about nothing\" style and filmed in real-time, a format more often seen in early seasons. The episode follows the cast's misadventures as they try to escape from the traffic surrounding the Puerto Rican Day Parade.\nThis episode of Seinfeld has more writer credits (ten) than any other episode. As co-creator Larry David was returning to write the finale, this was the final episode for the active \"after Larry David\" writing staff and thus was a group effort.\nBecause of controversy surrounding a scene in which Cosmo Kramer accidentally burns and then stomps on the Puerto Rican flag, NBC apologized and had it banned from airing on the network again. Also, it was not initially part of the syndicated package. In the summer of 2002, the episode started to appear with the flag-burning sequence intact. In 2023, the episode was available to watch along with the rest of the series on Netflix.",
